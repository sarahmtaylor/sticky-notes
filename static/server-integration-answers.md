Step 1: Remove localStorage Dependencies
    1.1 Remove localStorage Properties: The storageKey was a string identifier used to store and retrieve sticky note data from localStorage. With server integration, data persistence shifts to the backend, making the use of storageKey obsolete. Keeping it would cause confusion and potential redundancy, so it should be removed.(e.g: GPT-4o).

    1.2 localStorage Method Removal
    loadFromLocalStorage()
    Purpose: Loaded existing sticky note data from the browser’s localStorage.
    Reason for removal: The server now handles data retrieval.
    saveToLocalStorage()
    Purpose: Persisted sticky note data in localStorage during creation/editing.
    Reason for removal: Persistence is now handled by a server endpoint.(e.g: GPT-4o).

    1.3 Watcher Update
    Previously, the watcher triggered saveToLocalStorage() on data changes. Now, it triggers a debounced saveToServer() function. This shift enables asynchronous saving to a remote backend instead of immediate saving to localStorage.(e.g: GPT-4o).


Step 2: Add Server Integration Properties
    2.1 New Data Properties
    currentStickiesId – Stores the ID of the sticky set currently loaded from the server.
    isLoading – Indicates if the application is currently fetching or saving data.
    hasUnsavedChanges – Tracks if there are unsaved changes pending a server update.
    saveTimeout – Holds the setTimeout reference for debouncing saves.
    loadError – Tracks whether a server-side fetch has failed.
    isSaving – Flags whether a save operation is currently in progress.(e.g: GPT-4o).

    2.2 Property Relationships
    When a user edits a sticky:
    hasUnsavedChanges is set to true.
    A saveTimeout is initialized to delay saveToServer() execution.
    If another edit happens before the timeout, the previous timeout is cleared.
    During save execution, isLoading or isSaving is toggled to indicate the pending operation and manage UI state.(e.g: GPT-4o).


Step 3: Implement URL Detection and Loading
    3.1 URL Pattern Validation
    The regex used is: /^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{10}$/
    This ensures only valid, expected ID formats (e.g., Firebase-like keys) are accepted, preventing malformed or malicious inputs from triggering invalid server requests.(e.g: GPT-4o).

    3.2 Mounted Lifecycle Changes
    Valid ID:
    Extracted from URL using regex.
    loadFromServer(id) is called.
    If successful, stickies are populated with data from server.
    Invalid or Missing ID:
    Falls back to refreshToNewStickySet() to create a new default sticky note.
    A new ID may be created and the user is redirected via history.pushState().(e.g: GPT-4o).


Step 4: Create Server Communication Methods
    4.1 loadFromServer() Method
    Success (200 OK):
    Stickies are populated with fetched data.
    Not Found (404):
    Application assumes invalid ID and calls refreshToNewStickySet().
    Server Error (500 or network failure):
    Sets loadError to true; user may be prompted to retry.(e.g: GPT-4o).

    4.2 saveToServer() Logic Split
    PUT:
    Used when there are one or more sticky notes to save.
    Payload includes the updated sticky list, saved to the server.
    DELETE:
    Used when the stickies array is empty.
    The sticky set is removed from the server database.(e.g: GPT-4o).

    4.3 Error Handling Strategy
    Loading errors:
    Set loadError = true, UI may display an error message or retry option.
    Saving errors:
    Set hasUnsavedChanges = true to retry later.
    Optionally show a non-blocking warning.(e.g: GPT-4o).

Step 5: Implement Debounced Auto-Save
    5.1 Debouncing Mechanism
    When triggered, debouncedSave():
    Clears any existing timeout using clearTimeout(saveTimeout).
    Sets a new timeout (e.g., setTimeout(saveToServer, 1000)).
    This avoids sending frequent server requests while typing, saving only after 1 second of inactivity.(e.g: GPT-4o).
   
    5.2 New vs Existing Stickies
    If currentStickiesId is null, it indicates no existing set.
    A new sticky set is POSTed to the server.
    Prevents overwriting existing data and avoids duplicate entries.(e.g: GPT-4o).

    5.3 URL History Management
    Uses history.pushState() to update the URL with the new ID.
    Benefit: No page reload, preserves app state, and enables sharing the URL with others.(e.g: GPT-4o).

Step 6: Handle Deletion with Dedicated DELETE Route
    6.1 RESTful API Design
    POST /stickies – Create a new sticky set.
    GET /stickies/:id – Retrieve an existing sticky set.
    PUT /stickies/:id – Update an existing sticky set.
    DELETE /stickies/:id – Delete a sticky set.
    These follow RESTful design by using HTTP methods to represent CRUD operations on a singular resource (stickies).(e.g: GPT-4o).

    6.2 Deletion Logic
    When last sticky is deleted:
    The entire set is deleted from the server (DELETE call).
    refreshToNewStickySet() is invoked.
    When others remain:
    A PUT request updates the server with the reduced stickies array.(e.g: GPT-4o).

    6.3 State Reset Process
    Creates a new sticky note with default values.
    Resets currentStickiesId to null.
    Invoked when:
    No valid ID is provided.
    Loading fails.
    All notes are deleted.(e.g: GPT-4o).

Step 7: Add Bonus Features
    7.1 Share Functionality
    If no currentStickiesId, it triggers a save to generate one.
    Constructs a shareable URL (window.location.origin + '/#/' + id).
    Tries to use the Clipboard API to copy the URL.
    Fallback: If Clipboard API fails, shows the link in a prompt for manual copying.(e.g: GPT-4o).
   
    7.2 Clear Storage Update
    Old version: Cleared localStorage entries only.
    New version:
    Sends a DELETE request to remove the sticky set from the server.
    Resets in-memory variables (stickies, currentStickiesId, etc.).
    Optionally triggers refreshToNewStickySet() to reset the UI.(e.g: GPT-4o).


Comprehensive Understanding Questions
    C.1 Migration Benefits
    localStorage: tied to one device, collaboration not possible, manual/unsupported sharing, browser limited, easy to clear/cache
    Server Integration: synced across devices, enables shared access, URL based sharing, scalable storage, server side backups(e.g: GPT-4o).

    C.2 Data Flow Analysis
    User types in a sticky note.
    stickies array is updated → triggers a Vue watcher.
    Watcher calls debouncedSave().
    saveTimeout is set (e.g., 1000ms).
    After timeout, saveToServer() is executed.
    If currentStickiesId is null → createNewStickiesOnServer() is called → returns new ID.
    A PUT request is made with updated stickies.
    If error occurs, hasUnsavedChanges = true and retry is scheduled.(e.g: GPT-4o).
